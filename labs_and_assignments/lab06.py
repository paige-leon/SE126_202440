#PROGRAM PROMPT:Write a program that can be used by a small theater to sell tickets for performances. The
#theaterâ€™s auditorium has 15 rows of seats with 30 seats in each row. The program should display
#a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. Seats thar are available are
#represented by # and seats that are taken are represent by a *.
#There are aisles after seats H and V.


#Variable Dictionary
#-----------------------------------
#seats[][]    15*30 array for seat availabillity chart
#rowlayout    worker variable for printing the seat map

#Notes
#in seats[][] 0 = empty and 1 = full
